        The two artistic and sound-themed websites Intersymmetric and Hold Space
        both utilize minimalist aesthetics and emotional-driven web experiences,
        but the way they design interaction are very different.

        <h2>Information Design</h2>
        <p>
          Intersymmetric uses an abstract approach in information design that
          users are presented with three different colored titles on a white
          background while entering to present different modules, there are
          limited instructions but have some patterns with simple labels to show
          the affordance, this allows users to explore through visual control
          options alone, creating an open-ended experience, but it can also make
          users feel uncertain about the purpose or function of the interaction.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">

      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          However, Hold Space presents a clear and minimal instruction through
          the phrase “turn on the volume and press and hold the space bar”,
          which directly bring users to the interaction. This whole website
          utilizes the back and white style with simple line shapes, which this
          minimalist aesthetic focuses on the operational and emotional
          experience.

    <!-- Mapping Section -->
    <section class="analysis-section mapping">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Mapping</h2>
        <p>
          The two websites applied different mapping methods. Intersymmetric
          applies a modular and multi-parameter system, there are various
          control elements like sliders, buttons and knobs, which each one
          reflects to different functions like rhythm, textures, and volume.
          This one-to-one mapping allow users to experience and provide
          precision, but is more design for people who understand music, but not
          transparent for normal users.

      <div class="image">
        <img src="inter-map.png" alt="inter-map" />
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Contrarily, Hold Space uses singular and intuitive mapping, users only
          need to press the space bar to trigger the interactions with sounds
          and visuals, which people don’t need any foundation skills or
          technique, is a direct and simple mapping system.

    <!--Characteristic section  -->
    <section class="analysis-section characteristic">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Characteristic</h2>
        <p>
          The characteristic of Intersymmetric is functional and experimental,
          it utilizes warm colours to create a playful tone, which softness the
          technical nature. This website and the generative audio tool share the
          same aesthetic; therefore, it is more designed for people who have a
          basic understanding of music.

        <p>
          In contrast, Hold Space is based on black and white, and is
          characterized by simple and moving geometric shapes. This calming
          auditory experience and visual effect gives people a calm atmosphere,
          which designed for anyone who enjoy sounds and motion graphics.

    <!-- Feedback section-->
    <section class="analysis-section feedback">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Intersymmetric provides functional feedback that when users adjust the
          above parameters, they can immediately get the reflects of sounds and
          graphical interface. Because there are no specific instructions, so
          the effective of the feedback depend on how users interact with the
          interface and how they control and interpret the changes.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="inter-feedback.png" alt="inter-feedback" />
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Similarly, in Hold Space, when people press the spacebar, they can
          immediately see visual effects changes like background color and
          geometric shapes expansion with ambient audio, but Hold Space is more
          relate to immersive emotional resonance but not technical clarity.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          The interfaces of the Intersymmetric and Hold Space include different
          design strategies while express their distinct interaction goals.
          Intersymmetric focus on experimental sounds mastery through
          multi-panel layout and parameter-driven interactions to let the users
          can granularly control and explore their own creative experiences. On
          the other hand, Hold Space evokes emotional immersion through
          contemplative audiovisual experience, users only need to press a
          button to enter the interaction, this simplicity promotes emotional
          impact rather than productivity. Similarly, both websites emphasize
          immediate feedback, and users can receive visual and auditory feedback
          while taking actions. This contrast illustrates how interaction design
          and feedback mechanisms, combined with the intended interaction goals,
          can shape different experiences and feelings for users.
